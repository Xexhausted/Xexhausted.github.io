Ask questions that no one has asked yet (and sometimes regret it). Overthink everything. Yes, even my choice of socks. üß¶ Attempt to crack passwords (legally, of course üòÖ). My Expertise: # Investigating the unknown, just like a detective, minus the trench coat (because, you know\u0026hellip; Wayland). Researching obscure topics and connecting dots that aren\u0026rsquo;t even there (yet). Writing things you probably didn‚Äôt ask for, but now you have to read them. üòé My Motto: # \u0026ldquo;The only thing I investigate more than mysteries\u0026hellip; is the next cup of coffee.\u0026rdquo;\nP.S. If you know the meaning of life, feel free to let me know.
