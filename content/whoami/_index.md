I am **Xexhausted**, a curious human powered by an endless supply of coffee, curiosity, and the unyielding desire to *investigate* all the things!

I love to:
- Dive deep into research (sometimes too deep, like a rabbit hole).
- Ask questions that no one has asked yet (and sometimes regret it).
- Overthink everything. Yes, even my choice of socks. 🧦
- Attempt to crack passwords (legally, of course 😅). 

### My Expertise:
- Investigating the unknown, just like a detective, minus the trench coat (because, you know... Wayland).
- Researching obscure topics and connecting dots that aren't even there (yet).
- Writing things you probably didn’t ask for, but now you have to read them. 😎

### My Motto:
_"The only thing I investigate more than mysteries... is the next cup of coffee."_

P.S. If you know the meaning of life, feel free to let me know. I'm still investigating! 🕵️‍♂️
